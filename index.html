              <p><i><B><font size="5">Chittagong<font/></B>The region of Chittagong is traditionally centred around its seaport which has existed since ancient
                times. The region was home to the ancient independent Buddhist kingdoms of Samatata and Harikela.[1] It later fell under
                 of the rule of the Gupta Empire, the Pala Empire and the Arakanese kingdom of Waithali until the 7th century. Arab Muslims
                  traded with the port from as early as the 9th century. Historian Lama Taranath is of the view that the Buddhist king 
                  Gopichandra had his capital at Chittagong in the 10th century. According to Tibetan tradition, this century marked the 
                  birth of Tantric Buddhism in the region.[2] The region has been explored by numerous historic travellers, most notably 
                  Ibn Battuta of Morocco who visited in the 14th century. During this time, the region was conquered and incorporated into 
                  the independent Sonargaon Sultanate by Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah in 1340 AD.[3] Sultan Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah constructed a
                   highway from Chittagong to Chandpur and ordered the construction of many lavish mosques and tombs. After the defeat of 
                   the Sultan of Bengal Ghiyasuddin Mahmud Shah in the hands of Sher Shah Suri in 1538, the Arakanese Kingdom of Mrauk U 
                   managed to regain Chittagong. From this time onward, until its conquest by the Mughal Empire, the region was under the 
                   control of the Portuguese and the Magh pirates (a notorious name for Arakanese) for 128 years.[2]<Br>

               The Mughal commander Shaista Khan, his son Buzurg Umed Khan, and Farhad Khan, expelled the Arakanese from the area during the
                Conquest of Chittagong in 1666 and established Mughal rule there. After the Arakanese expulsion, Islamabad, as the area came 
                to be known, made great strides in economic progress. This can mainly be attributed to an efficient system of land-grants to 
                selected diwans or faujdars to clear massive areas of hinterland and start cultivation. The Mughals, similar to the Afghans 
                who came earlier, also built mosques having a rich contribution to the architecture in the area. What is called Chittagong 
                today also began to have improved connections with the rest of Mughal Bengal. The city was occupied by Burmese troops shortly 
                in First Anglo-Burmese War in 1824 and the British increasingly grew active in the region and it fell under the British Empire.
                 The people of Chittagong made several attempts to gain independence from the British, notably on 18 November 1857 when the 2nd,
                  3rd, and 4th companies of the 34th Bengal Infantry Regiment stationed at Chittagong rose in rebellion and released all the 
                  prisoners from jail but were suppressed by the Kuki scouts and the Sylhet Light Infantry (10th Gurkha Rifles).[2]

                      <p>The Sundarban (Bengali: সুন্দরবন Shundorbôn) is the largest single block of tidal halophytic mangrove forest in the world.
                         The name Sundarban can be literally translated as “beautiful jungle” or “beautiful forest” in the Bengali language 
                         (Sundar, “beautiful” and ban, “forest” or “jungle”). The name may have been derived from the Sundari trees that are 
                         found in Sundarbans in large numbers.

                        Alternatively, it has been proposed that the name is a corruption of Samudraban (Bengali: সমুদ্রবন Shomudrobôn “Sea Forest”)
                        or Chandra-bandhe (name of a primitive tribe). But the generally accepted view is the one associated with Sundari trees.
